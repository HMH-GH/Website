  <h1>Hadi M Haadi!"</h1>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>So, as a career pivot, I have embarked on a thrilling new adventure into the world of tech. I have always had a passion for tech since I was young as I was always intrigued on how anything was made from sratch! I have a creative mindset with an interest in art, DIY, Product Design and Engineering. Until I stumbled across programming which opened my mind to a whole new world! <br><br>
    This lead me to joining a Software Development course with JUST IT allowing my tech journey to begin!</p>

    <h3>Interests</h3>
      <p>When I'm learning how to code, you can find me either in the gym, playing basketball, golf, 8 ball or catching up with the stock/crypto market.</p>
